1.Preprocess the input image:
    - Convert the image to grayscale.
    - Apply thresholding to create a binary image.

2.Recognize the table structure:
    - Remove small contours from the binary image.
    - Detect horizontal and vertical lines in the image.
    - Combine the line-detected images.
    - Erode and dilate the image to enhance the table structure.
    - Extract contours and bounding boxes of table cells.
    - Sort and organize the bounding boxes into rows and columns.
    - Return the final table structure and a processed image containing the table.

3.Extract text from the table image:
    - Use Tesseract OCR to extract the text and layout information from the table image.

4.Create a CSV file from the extracted text data:
    - Reconstruct the table rows based on the extracted text and layout information.
    - Write the reconstructed table to a CSV file.
